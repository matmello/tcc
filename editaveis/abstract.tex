 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   This study had the main objective to design an Artifitial Recurrent Neural Network,
   implemented in the BrainBot software development, which aims to predict transition
   changes in the Forex Exchange. A case study evidenced the functionality of the software
   developed in an especific context, the foreign exchange pair gold-dolar (XAU/USD).
   SCRUM techniques were adopted in the development of the software, separating the
   software functionalities in features, user histories and tasks. Different neural
   networks types were addressed and the choice of the recurrent neural network as the inputs
   to be used by the software. The results were registred in a hit percentage format,
   using a backtesting technique. Unit and integration tests were implemented, considering
   the context rigorousness. Finally the conslusion was reported
